# CleanCites

**CleanCites** is a simple Firefox/Chromium extension designed to help you hide or highlight citations in browser-based scientific journals. Whether you're trying to declutter your reading experience or focus on references, CleanCites makes it easier to control how citations appear while browsing academic papers.

We are currently submitting the addon to relevant addon stores.

## Features
